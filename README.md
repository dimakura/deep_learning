This repository contains my work on [Fast.ai course](http://fast.ai) including examples and assignments.

## Scripts

For running machine learning code I used [Google Cloud](http://cloud.google.com) platform
([Fast.ai](http://fast.ai) uses AWS) because it provides free $300 credit, which is sufficient
to complete the whole course.

`scripts/` directory contains useful scripts for creating, managing and accessing compute instances
at Google Cloud.

You can read more about using scripts from corresponding [readme file](scripts/README.md).
